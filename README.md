# Poker Game

This code creates a poker game. It starts by creating a new deck of cards and shuffling it. Then it distributes 5 cards to the player and shows them. The player is then asked if they want to keep or discard each card, and can choose to keep all or discard all. The hand is then sorted by value, and the result is validated against different poker hands (royal flush, straight flush, etc.). If the hand matches one of these hands, the player wins; otherwise, he lose.
